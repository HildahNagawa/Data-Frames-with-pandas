# Data-Frames-with-pandas

This project focuses on creating a custom dataset (or database) and applying various DataFrame functions to manipulate, and analyze the data. The goal was to explore the use of Pandas with DataFrames, including techniques like indexing, slicing, sorting, filtering, and aggregating. This project helps in understanding how to efficiently manage and analyze structured data using Python.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project was gotten from Data wars in one of their tutorials on Data Frames. You can check out the project https://profiles.datawars.io/hildahnagawa15/projects/fd14fc5a-e4fc-4ac0-835b-5d83a410734f page and my account https://profiles.datawars.io/hildahnagawa15. 

Tools Used:

Python
Pandas

Approach:

Created the dataset with Pandas DataFrame.
Used various DataFrame functions such as .loc[], .head(), .describe(), .drop(), slicing, round to manipulate and analyze the data.

Results:
Gained insights into how DataFrame operations can help efficiently handle  datasets.
